# djapScheduler
A minimial scheduler for AVR microcontrollers
Uploading a scheduler I originally created for a university programming assignment. This is not a full realtime OS, just a simple scheduler for switching between tasks, minimal enough for anyone to see what it's doing at a single glance.

To use the scheduler, add djapScheduler.h and djapScheduler.c to the project. All configurations must be done to the code in the files, but again, they are small enough so that going through them shouldn't be too hard.

NOTE: This code was on a printed paper from which I re-typed it. I haven't tested or even compiled the code yet since re-typing it. Samples and tested version will follow.
